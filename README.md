![project_layout](https://github.com/S4ule/saule_engine/blob/main/doc/project.png?raw=true)
Note the the project layout is not 100% true anymore, but i give a good idea of the project.

# Build
First make sure you have all the lib installed in your system, here the list of lib used in the Makefile:
- libglfw3 
- libGL
- libX11
- libXrandr
- libXi

If you have all the build you can type `make` and the project will automaticly build everything for you.
After you can run the project with `./scop`.
